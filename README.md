# UFOs

## Overview of Project: 
We created a webpage for UFO sightings that uses JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, and D3.js.

This project demonstrates the use of Javascript to style an interactive website, using D3.js to collect HTML form elements in the form of Document Object Models, including a banner with background picture, style theme, title and intoduction paragraphs, table dataset, filters and buttons.  

## Results: 
Filters were added to the webpage to alter the given dataset based on user entries and by pressing the Enter key, including Date, City, State, Country, and Shape. The user can enter one or any number of these filters to return the filtered table displayed on the page. Additionally, there is a reload button which resets the table to its unfiltered state and a Download button which allows the user to download the table in either JSON or CSV format.

## Summary: 
To summarize, Dana can now have her audience go to her published webpage to gather the requested data, by using filters that pull only the necessary data from our source file, and download the table to a JSON or CSV formtat.
